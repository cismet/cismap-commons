 * structure and thus allows fast bounding box requests. This is especially useful
 * for StaticFeature Services which may require a FeatureFactory to pre-allocate
 * all available Features (e.g. from a SHAPE or GML File). In contrast to a
 * ordinary FeatureFactory which caches only the features of the last
 * {@code createFeatures} request the CachingFeatureFactory may cache features
 * upon initialisation and/or upon each request to the {@code createFeatures}
 * operation. If the factory is able to cache <b>all</b> features upon
 * initialisation (e.g. when loading small GML or SHP files), the {@code createFeatures}
 * request is always executed on the cache.
