/**
 * The CachingFeatureFactory stores retrieved features in a spatial index structure and thus allows fast bounding box
 * requests. This is especially useful for StaticFeature Services which may require a FeatureFactory to pre-allocate all
 * available Features (e.g. from a SHAPE or GML File). In contrast to a ordinary FeatureFactory which caches only the
 * features of the last {@code createFeatures} request the CachingFeatureFactory may cache features upon initialisation
 * and/or upon each request to the {@code createFeatures} operation. If the factory is able to cache <b>all</b> features
 * upon initialisation (e.g. when loading small GML or SHP files), the {@code createFeatures} request is always executed
 * on the cache.
